Mary and Dispatch,

Can a ticket please be opened for this. They are claiming there are issues 
with the web install that took place yesterday by Andrew. Mary can you ensure 
this ticket gets looked into for Nhu.

Thanks

Hi Dan -

The server housing the IIS is WINNETP27.  I just realized that IIS was not 
installed to the proper location, but that should not matter.

I expect to see the Web app content in the following location, but it's empty.

No rush.  Please send me a Web Ex when you can to look at this today.
Thanks.

Nhu,

I am unavailable right now to do a WebEx. I can email you when I become 
available (hour or so).

What is the server housing IIS? Andrew should have installed web apps on that 
server and can be located at C:\Infortel Select\Programs\dashboard.

If it's only working for https://winnetp27/dashboard/ then it's something to 
do with DNS or the fact that you are forcing a secure connection to the web 
page. (http vs https). When we install we by default install as http.
So I would just use the https address you have because it looks like you did 
some extra work in IIS that forces the use of https.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Thanks

Subject: RE: URL link for the web server

Hi Dan -

I am at a lost as I wasn't there in the session when Andrew was 
installing/configuring the web app.  My question right now is I don't know 
where the content of the web app was installed/stored in.  The web link is not 
working.  Like the email  you indicated below, it should work when we use 
(http://170.11.193.32/dashboard).  But it's only working for 
https://winnetp27/dashboard/

I tried changing the path of the default site to point to e:\InfortelSelect 
\Programs\Dashboard, but no success yet.

Can we do a quick WebEx on this or do we need Andrew to help out on this?

I believe if IIS is installed you should be able to browse the server name or 
IP Address and you should get the IIS splash screen which tells you that it 
should be working OK. That is until tomorrow when we load the application web 
pages (http://170.11.193.32/dashboard).  In regards to the redirect link DNS 
entry, that would have to be determined by your organization, as we would not 
be able to support that aspect of the configuration.

Thanks

Hi Dan -

I just want to check with you if there's anything I need to do further before 
the upgrade tomorrow.  I know that you already looked at the web server and 
checked out all IIS configurations and features via WebEx awhile ago and gave 
me the OK.  I have now requested the DNS address to be hooked to the new 
server's IP address.  I also installed the certificate and enabled SSL.

However, when I tried to test the web link through the new URL 
https://phonereports.securian.com and through the physical IP address 
(170.11.193.32), there's a connection issue.  I suspect that the link is not 
working properly now because the server itself is just a shell and is not 
ready to load anything yet until tomorrow.

However, I just want to be sure that that is the case or if I need to do 
anything further to get ready for tomorrow's upgrade.

Thanks for responding.
